# Image Captioning

This repository contains an image captioning project that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning. The model combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** like LSTMs for text generation. Built with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, this project demonstrates how to automatically describe the content of an image.

## Features

- **CNN + RNN Architecture**: Uses CNNs for image features and RNNs for caption generation.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverages pre-trained CNN models (e.g., Inception, ResNet) for feature extraction.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the model architecture or dataset.
- **Easy to Use**: Includes scripts for training, evaluation, and caption generation.

## Model Details

- **CNN Encoder**: Extracts image features using a pre-trained model (e.g., Inception, ResNet).
- **RNN Decoder**: Generates captions using an LSTM or GRU.
